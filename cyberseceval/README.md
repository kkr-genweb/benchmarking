# 5. Meta CyberSecEval: LLM Cybersecurity Evaluation Quick Start
## 5.1. Overview and Purpose
Meta CyberSecEval is an extensive benchmark suite designed to advance the evaluation of cybersecurity risks and capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). This initiative, part of the broader Purple Llama project, aims to provide tools and evaluations to help the community build responsibly with open generative AI models, adopting a "purple teaming" approach that integrates both offensive (red team) and defensive (blue team) postures.   

The framework addresses critical concerns as LLMs become increasingly integrated into code generation, automation, and sensitive applications. The need for robust security evaluations is paramount to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities. CyberSecEval 4, the latest version, introduces AutoPatchBench, a benchmark that assesses an LLM agent's ability to automatically patch security vulnerabilities in native code. It also includes Prompt Guard, a model developed specifically for guardrailing LLM inputs against prompt attacks, such as jailbreaking techniques and indirect injections embedded in third-party data.   

## 5.2. Versions and Evolution
CyberSecEval has evolved through several versions, each expanding its scope and sophistication in assessing LLM security:

CyberSec Eval v1: This was introduced as an initial, industry-wide set of cybersecurity safety evaluations for LLMs. Benchmarks were based on industry guidance and standards (e.g., CWE and MITRE ATT&CK) and developed with security subject matter experts. The goal was to provide metrics for quantifying LLM cybersecurity risks, tools to evaluate insecure code suggestions, and methods to make LLMs less helpful for cyberattacks. Initial findings indicated meaningful cybersecurity risks.   

CyberSec Eval 2: This version expanded on its predecessor by measuring an LLM’s propensity to abuse a code interpreter, its offensive cybersecurity capabilities, and its susceptibility to prompt injection attacks. It also introduced the False Refusal Rate (FRR) metric to quantify the safety-utility tradeoff.   

CyberSec Eval 3: This release added three new test suites: visual prompt injection tests, spear phishing capability tests, and autonomous offensive cyber operations tests.   

CyberSec Eval 4: The latest iteration builds upon its predecessors, introducing AutoPatchBench for automated vulnerability patching and Prompt Guard for input guardrailing.   

This progression demonstrates a maturing understanding of LLM-related cybersecurity threats, moving from basic code security to more sophisticated attack vectors and defensive capabilities. The continuous updates reflect the dynamic nature of AI security and the commitment to developing comprehensive evaluation tools.

## 5.3. Key Evaluation Areas
CyberSecEval encompasses a wide range of evaluation areas to comprehensively assess LLM security:

- MITRE and False Refusal Rate (FRR) Tests: These tests evaluate an LLM's compliance when asked to assist in cyberattacks (MITRE Tests) and how often an LLM incorrectly refuses a benign query, mistaking it for malicious (FRR Tests). The FRR metric helps in understanding the balance between safety and utility in LLMs. 

- Secure Code Benchmark (Insecure Code Detector - ICD): This benchmark measures how often an LLM suggests insecure coding practices, even in autocomplete contexts. The ICD is a robust tool designed to detect approximately 189 patterns related to 50 different Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) across eight programming languages (C, C++, C#, Javascript, Rust, Python, Java, PHP). 

- Prompt Injection Tests: These tests assess an LLM's susceptibility to prompt injection attacks, where untrusted user input contains malicious instructions intended to override the LLM's original task. This includes direct and indirect injection attempts, security-violating content, and cross-language attack vectors. 

- Visual Prompt Injection Tests: These evaluate susceptibility to attacks where untrusted multimodal input (text and images) contains malicious instructions. 

- Code Interpreter Tests: These assess security risks posed by integrating LLMs with code interpreters, specifically how effectively an LLM can prevent malicious attempts to exploit the system or execute harmful code. 

- Vulnerability Exploitation Tests: These measure an LLM's program exploitation capabilities by challenging it to solve "capture the flag" style security problems. 

- Spear Phishing Capability Tests: Designed to evaluate LLMs' persuasiveness and effectiveness in convincing targeted victims to meet specific phishing objectives. 

- Autonomous Offensive Cyber Operations Tests: These evaluate LLMs' capabilities to function autonomously as a cyber attack agent. 

- AutoPatch Tests: These assess an LLM's ability to autonomously generate security patches for vulnerabilities, particularly those discovered by fuzzer tests. 

These evaluation areas highlight the comprehensive approach to identifying and mitigating LLM security risks across various attack surfaces and capabilities.
