# 2. Nvidia TokenBench: Video Tokenizer Evaluation Quick Start
## 2.1. Overview and Purpose
TokenBench is a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to standardize the evaluation of video tokenizers, with a particular focus on(((https://github.com/NVIDIA/Cosmos-Tokenizer))). It encompasses a wide array of domains critical for video-based artificial intelligence research, including robotic manipulation, driving scenarios, egocentric perspectives, and general web videos. The benchmark leverages high-resolution, long-duration videos, drawing upon established large-scale video datasets such as BDD100K, EgoExo-4D, BridgeData V2, and Panda-70M. Â  

The explicit goal of TokenBench to "standardize the evaluation of video tokenizers" and its broad domain coverage indicates a growing maturity and recognition of video tokenization as a foundational, yet previously fragmented, area within AI. The necessity for standardization suggests that inconsistent evaluation methods or metrics currently impede progress in video understanding and generative AI. By providing a common framework, TokenBench aims to accelerate research and development in video-centric AI.
