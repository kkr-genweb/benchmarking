# AI/ML Benchmarks for the Real World Grounded and  Trustworthy Agentic Web

In today's rapidly changing AI landscape, understanding and leveraging benchmarks is crucial for business decision makers. The benchmarks below can help evaluate AI systems where real world understanding and trustworthy agentic operation are critical.

- **nuScenes (Autonomous Driving):** This benchmark is helpful for evaluating AI systems designed to interact with the physical world. nuScenes provides comprehensive, real-world sensor data (cameras, LIDAR, RADAR) , enabling the development and validation of AI models for perception, localization, and planning. Leveraging nuScenes allows businesses to develop and demonstrate safety-critical AI for mobility applications. [nuScenes](https://www.nuscenes.org/object-detection?externalData=all&mapData=all&modalities=Any)  (for autonomous vehicles, robotics, mobile AR games, and advanced environmental understanding)
- **Nvidia TokenBench (Synthetic Video & Visual AI):** For industries reliant on visual data, such as media, entertainment, manufacturing, and augmented reality, TokenBench offers a standardized way to evaluate video tokenizers. This focuses on the efficiency and quality of video understanding and generation. By utilizing TokenBench, businesses can develop and validate AI that creates high-fidelity synthetic video, enables advanced AR applications, and enhances manufacturing quality control through sophisticated visual AI.  [nVidia TokenBench](https://github.com/NVlabs/TokenBench) (for consumer video, AR glasses, and manufacturing) 
- **Project Data Sphere (Synthetic Data in Health):** In sensitive and highly regulated sectors like healthcare, the ability to securely and effectively leverage specialized data is essential. Project Data Sphere facilitates open access to de-identified, patient-level cancer clinical trial data. This enables the development of AI models for predictive analytics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. Utilizing this platform allows businesses to drive tangible patient outcomes and accelerate scientific discovery by responsibly harnessing specialized, high-value datasets.  [Project DataSphere](https://data.projectdatasphere.org/projectdatasphere/html/home) (for clinical trial oversight) 
- **Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (LLM Tool Calling Evaluation):** This leaderboard evaluates the critical capability of AI models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), to accurately invoke functions or tools. This is essential for building robust, agentic AI systems that can automate complex workflows and integrate with existing software. Excelling on this leaderboard demonstrates the ability to create AI solutions that can precisely execute tasks by interacting with external systems.

- **Meta CyberSecEval (LLM Cybersecurity Evaluation):** As AI systems become integral to business operations, their security and trustworthiness are non-negotiable. CyberSecEval rigorously assesses AI vulnerabilities to attacks like prompt injection and insecure code generation. By utilizing CyberSecEval, businesses can ensure their AI solutions are built with advanced safeguards, capable of withstanding adversarial attacks, and suitable for deployment in critical, sensitive environments. This builds essential trust and reduces operational risk.
