# 1. nuScenes: Autonomous Driving Dataset Quick Start
## 1.1. Overview and Purpose
nuScenes is a public, large-scale dataset specifically developed for autonomous driving by Motional (formerly nuTonomy). Its fundamental purpose is to accelerate the development of safer, more reliable, and accessible driverless vehicles. The dataset represents a significant advancement over earlier benchmarks, such as the pioneering KITTI dataset. nuScenes distinguishes itself by providing data from the complete sensor suite of an autonomous vehicle, including six cameras, one LIDAR, five RADAR units, GPS, and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). This comprehensive sensor integration results in seven times more object annotations compared to KITTI.   

The dataset is meticulously curated, comprising 1000 scenes, each 20 seconds in duration. These scenes are carefully selected and human-annotated to ensure diversity across various locations, times of day, and weather conditions, as well as to balance the frequency distribution of different object classes. The inclusion of a comprehensive sensor suite coupled with detailed calibration procedures for LIDAR, cameras, and RADAR is essential. This meticulous calibration ensures the high fidelity and accuracy required for robust autonomous driving research. Without this precise calibration, combining information from disparate sensors would lead to significant errors, undermining the utility of the dataset for real-world self-driving applications. This process is not merely a feature but a critical enabler for precise sensor fusion and subsequent tasks like perception, localization, and mapping.
