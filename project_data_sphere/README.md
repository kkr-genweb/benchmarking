# 3. Project Data Sphere: Oncology Data Sharing Platform Quick Start
## 3.1. Overview and Mission
Project Data Sphere (PDS) is an independent, not-for-profit digital library-laboratory operating without cost to users. Its core mission is to enhance outcomes for cancer patients by facilitating the open sharing, integration, and analysis of historical, de-identified, patient-level data derived from academic and industry Phase II-III cancer clinical trials. PDS was established in 2014 as an initiative of the CEO Roundtable on Cancer, an organization founded in 2001 by President George H. W. Bush.   

The platform currently hosts a substantial volume of data, including over 205 patient-level datasets, which collectively represent more than 260,000 patient lives. These contributions come from over 18 data providers, and the platform has played a role in facilitating over 135 peer-reviewed publications. The model of providing free, open-access, de-identified patient-level clinical trial data with integrated analytics tools represents a significant movement in medical research towards democratizing access to high-value, sensitive data. This collaborative approach aims to accelerate scientific discovery and the development of effective treatments by lowering barriers for researchers globally, fostering a more open science ecosystem in oncology. This directly addresses the historical challenge of data silos in medical research.
